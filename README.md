### SYNOPSIS

This is a port of Twine to a local browser-based app. See

### INSTALL

Run `npm install` at the top level of the directory to install all goodies.

### BUILDING

Run `grunt` to perform a basic build, including creating documentation in doc/;
`grunt watch` will perform the same tasks whenever you make changes to the
source code. `grunt release` will minify everything to as few files as possible
into dist/.
