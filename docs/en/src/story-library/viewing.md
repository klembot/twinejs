# Viewing Stories

Most of the Story Library screen is taken up by a list of the stories in your
library. There will be a card for every story in your library, with a small
visual preview of its structure[^preview-color], how many passages it has, and
when it was last changed.

To select a story, click or tap on it. You can only select one story at a time.
Once selected, you can take action on the story using the top toolbar.

## Sorting Stories

By default, Twine will sort your library by story name, so that a story named
"Aardvark Revenge" will appear before "Zebra Brigade." You can instead have it
sort your stories so that the most recently-edited ones appear first by choosing
_Sort By_ under the _View_ top toolbar tab, then _Last Updated_. Choosing _Name_
under the same button will change back to sorting by name.

## Filtering Stories By Tag

You can [tag stories](tagging.md) to organize related ones together. Once you've
tagged a story, you can filter the Story Library screen to show only stories
with certain tags.

To do this, choose _Show Tags_ under the _View_ top toolbar tab. Choosing a
particular tag will cause only stories with that tag to be shown. You can select
multiple tags from the _Show Tags_ button. In that case, Twine will show any
story that has a checked tag name in the list.

To go back to showing all stories in your library, choose _Show All Stories_
from the _Show Tags_ button.

If the _Show Tags_ button is disabled, that's because you haven't tagged any
stories yet.

[^preview-color]: The color of your story preview is more-or-less randomly
    governed by your story's name. There isn't a significance to the
    colors--they're just there to help you find a particular story faster, and
    to look pretty.
