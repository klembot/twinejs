# Archiving and Exporting Stories

## Archiving Your Library

Archiving your library saves all stories in it to a single file. You can use an
archive as a way to back up your work, or to move your library between computers
or different web browsers.

To create an archive, choose the _Archive_ button under the _Library_ top
toolbar tab. You'll be asked where you'd like to save this file, and by default
its name contains the date and time when you created the archive.

## Exporting a Story

To export a single story, select it and choose _Publish to File_ from the
_Build_ top toolbar tab. You'll be asked where to save this file.

This file can be either opened directly in a web browser to play your story, or
[imported into Twine](creating.md).

The other buttons under the _Build_ tab work the same as they do in the [Story
Map Screen](../editing-stories).

## Exporting a Story To Twee

You can also export a story to [Twee
format](../getting-started/basic-concepts.html#twee). Select it and choose
_Export as Twee_ from the _Build_ top toolbar tab. You'll be asked where to save
this file.

Twine creates Twee files with a `.twee` file suffix. Your system may not know
how to handle them by default, but they are openable in any plain text editor,
like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on macOS.
