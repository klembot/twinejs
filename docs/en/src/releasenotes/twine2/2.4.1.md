# Twine 2.4.1

Release Date: July 13, 2022

## New Features and Improvements

The German localization has been improved (thanks @JimB16).
Updated the version of Electron used for app Twine to the latest v17 release.

## Bugs Fixed

Fixed a bug related to updating stories' story formats. This showed up in 2.4.0 as a crash message the first time a story was edited.

Browser Twine now uses the Storage Manager API to determine how much space is left for Twine to use. You may see a change in the value reported from previous versions, which estimated it by trying to save increasingly large amounts of data until it failed. This should fix error messages seen in 2.4.0 like `Failed to execute 'setItem' on 'Storage': Setting the value of 'twine-passages-abcdef-ghijklmn' exceeded the quota.`

Backups work properly in app Twine.

## Documentation

- A section on how to switch to an older version of Twine has been added.
- Small proofreading corrections (thanks @ChapelR).

## Story Formats

Harlowe is updated to 3.3.1. (changelog)

## Known Issues

Editing passage links, especially if you type [[ and ]] and then write a passage name, can create extraneous passages as you type, depending on how fast you type. An improvement on this behavior should come in the next feature release (there may be further bugfix releases before then).
