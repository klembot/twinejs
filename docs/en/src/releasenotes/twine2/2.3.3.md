# Twine 2.3.3

Release Date: July 22, 2019

## Bugs fixed

* Proofing stories, broken in 2.3.2, is working again.
* In previous versions, pressing control- or command-Z immediately after opening a text editor (passage, JavaScript, or stylesheet) would cause all text to be erased. This behavior no longer occurs.
* The German localization has been improved (thanks to Kai Brueckers).

## Features added

* Added a Catalan localization (thanks to Jordi Mallach).
* Added a Norwegian localization (thanks to sinwes).
