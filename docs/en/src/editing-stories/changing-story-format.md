# Changing the Story Format

To change a story's story format, choose _Details_ from the _Story_ top toolbar
tab. There's a menu in the dialog that opens that allows you to set a different
format.

Story formats must be [installed in Twine](../story-formats/adding.md) before
they appear in this menu.
