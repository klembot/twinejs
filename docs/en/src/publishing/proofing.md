# Proofing a Story

Proofing a story uses a special story format that is designed to make
proofreading and copyediting the text of your passages easier. You can proof a
story from both the Story Library and Story Map screens.

- In the Story Library screen, select the story, then choose _Proof_ from the
  _Build_ top toolbar tab.
- In the Story Map screen, choose _Proof_ from the _Build_ top toolbar tab.

The story format that's used for proofing is [set in Twine's Story Format
screen](../story-formats).
