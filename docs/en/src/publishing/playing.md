# Playing a Story

Twine allows you to play a story . This can be helpful if you'd like someone to
play your story on your own computer before publishing it, or to see exactly
what people will see when playing your story once it's published.

You can play a story from both the Story Library and Story Map screens.

- In the Story Library screen, select the story, then choose _Play_ from the
  _Build_ top toolbar tab.
- In the Story Map screen, choose _Play_ from the _Build_ top toolbar tab.

The address you see in your web browser while playing a game launched from Twine
will only work for you and your computer. It will not work for other people. To
share your story with other people, you will need to [publish
it](publishing.md).
