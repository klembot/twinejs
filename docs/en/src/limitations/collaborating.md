# Collaborating on Stories

Twine doesn't offer a way for multiple people to edit a story at once. The most
basic way to collaborate is to [export a story](../story-library/exporting.md)
and have your collaborators [import it](../story-library/creating.md) to work
with it themselves.

Another possibility is to use [source control](./source-control.md) to share
your stories, but this means learning how to use software like
[Git](https://git-scm.com). There are separate applications that can make
working with these systems easier that might be worth investigating if you're
not already familiar with them.

If you're using app Twine, using cloud storage services like Dropbox or Google
Drive to sync your story library is not recommended. It is very easy for these
services to get confused as to the state of your story files--they often try to
merge changes from different sources together on your behalf--and cause your
stories to become corrupted.
