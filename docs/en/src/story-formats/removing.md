# Removing a Story Format

To remove a story format, select its card in the Story Format screen and choose
_Remove_ from the _Story Format_ top toolbar tab. If this button is disabled,
you've selected a format that is built-in, or is currently your default or
proofing story format.

If a story uses a story format you've removed, you'll need to [change it to
another format](../editing-stories/changing-story-format.md). Twine will also
notice this problem the next time you start it and repair your story so that it
uses the closest story format version available.
