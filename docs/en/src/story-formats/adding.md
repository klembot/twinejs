# Adding a Story Format

To add a story format, you'll need to know its address. A story format should
include this in its documentation. A story format address must be a URL, with a
prefix like `https://` in front of it.

Once you know your story format's address, choose _Add_ from the _Story Format_
top toolbar tab and enter it in the dialog that appears. If Twine is able to
load the story format from the address you've entered, it will show a preview of
the format name and version you're adding. Choose _Add_ in the dialog to add it.
It'll appear in the list of story format cards immediately. You can now either
[set it as the default story format](default.md) or [change individual
stories](../editing-stories/changing-story-format.md) to use it, if you like.
