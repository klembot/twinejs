# Changing the Proofing Format

To change the proofing format, select its card in the Story Formats screen and
choose _Use to Proof Stories_ from the _Story Format_ top toolbar tab. A "Used
for Proofing" sticker will appear on the card to confirm the change. If the _Use
to Proof Stories_ button is disabled, the format you've selected is already the
proofing format, or the format you've selected is not a proofing format. (In
that case, you probably want to [set it as your default format](default.md)
instead.)
