# Changing the Default Story Format

To change the default story format, select its card in the Story Formats screen
and choose _Use as Default Format_ from the _Story Format_ top toolbar tab. A
"Used as Default" sticker will appear on the card to confirm the change. If the
_Use As Default_ button is disabled, the format you've selected is already the
default format, or the format you've selected is for proofing. (In that case,
you probably want to [set it as your proofing format](proofing.md) instead.)

Changing the default story format doesn't affect stories you've already created,
only new ones you create in the future. You [can change the story format for
existing stories](../editing-stories/changing-story-format.md) in the Story Map
screen.
