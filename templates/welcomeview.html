Hi!

<p>
Twine is an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories.
There are a few things you should know before you get started.

If you've never used Twine before, then welcome! The <a
href="http://twinery.org/wiki" target="_blank">official wiki</a> has great
resources to help you get started. Keep in mind that some articles
you'll encounter were written about Twine 1, which is a little bit different
than this version. But most of the concepts are the same.
</p>

<p>
You can also get help over at the <a href="http://twinery.org/forum"
target="_blank">Twine forum</a>, too.

<h1>
Your work is saved only in your browser.
</h1>

<p>
That means you don't need to create an account to use Twine 2, and everything
you create isn't stored on a server somewhere else &mdash; it stays right
in your browser.
</p>

<p>
Two <b>very important</b> things to remember, though. Since your work is saved
only in your browser, if you clear its saved data, then you'll lose your work!
Not good. Remember to use that <i
class="fa fa-briefcase"></i>&nbsp;<strong>Archive</strong> button often. You can
also publish individual stories to files using the dropdown menu next to the
<b><i class="fa fa-play"></i>&nbsp;Play</b> button in the story editor. Both
archive and story files can always be re-imported into Twine.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, <b>anyone who can use this browser can see and make changes to your
work</b>. So if you've got a nosy kid brother, look into setting up a separate
profile for yourself.
