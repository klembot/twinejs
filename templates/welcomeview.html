Hi!

<p>
Twine is an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories.
There are a few things you should know before you get started.

If you've never used Twine before, then welcome! The <a
href="http://twinery.org/wiki" target="_blank">official wiki</a> has great
resources to help you get started. Keep in mind that many articles
you'll encounter were written about Twine 1, which is a little bit different
than this version. But most of the concepts are the same.
</p>

<p>
You can also get help over at the <a href="http://twinery.org/forums"
target="_blank">Twine forums</a>, too.

Twine 2 is under construction.
</h1>

<p>
Right now it's still in alpha. That means that not all features have been
added, and you might run into bugs! To protect your work, you should export
your stories to a file often using the <strong><i class="fa fa-briefcase"></i>&nbsp;Archive</strong>
button in the story list. You can re-import these files anytime.
</p>

<p>
If you do encounter a bug or have a feature request, please <a
href="https://bitbucket.org/klembot/twinejs/issues?status=new&status=open"
target="_blank">report it</a>!
</p>

<div class="save paper shadow">

<h1>
Your work is saved<br>only in your browser.
</h1>

<p>
That means you don't need to create an account to use Twine 2, and everything
you create isn't stored on a server somewhere else &mdash; it stays right
in your browser.
</p>

<p>
Two <b>very important</b> things to remember, though. Since your work is saved
only in your browser, if you clear its saved data, then you'll lose your work!
Not good. Remember to use that <i
class="fa fa-briefcase"></i>&nbsp;<strong>Archive</strong> button often. You can
also publish individual stories to files using the dropdown menu next to the
<b><i class="fa fa-play"></i>&nbsp;Play</b> button in the story editor. Both
archive and story files can always be re-imported into Twine.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, <b>anyone who can use this browser can see and make changes to your
work</b>. So if you've got a nosy kid brother, look into setting up a separate
profile for yourself.
