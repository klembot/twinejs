Hi!
</h1>

<p>
Twine is an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories.
There are a few things you should know before you get started.

New here?

<p>
<strong>If you've never used Twine before,</strong> then welcome! The <a
href="http://twinery.org/2guide" target="_blank">Twine 2 Guide</a>, and the
official wiki in general, are a great place to learn. Keep in mind that some
articles on the wiki at large were written for Twine 1, which is a little bit
different than this version. But most of the concepts are the same.
</p>

<p>
You can also get help over at the <a href="http://twinery.org/forum"
target="_blank">Twine forum</a>, too.
</p>

<p>
<strong>If you have used Twine 1 before,</strong> the guide also has details on
what has changed in this version. Chief among them is a new default story
format, Harlowe. But if you find you prefer the Twine 1 scripting syntax, try
using SugarCube instead.

<h1>
Your work is saved only in your browser.
</h1>

<p>
That means you don't need to create an account to use Twine 2, and everything
you create isn't stored on a server somewhere else &mdash; it stays right
in your browser.
</p>

<p>
Two <b>very important</b> things to remember, though. Since your work is saved
only in your browser, if you clear its saved data, then you'll lose your work!
Not good. Remember to use that <i
class="fa fa-briefcase"></i>&nbsp;<strong>Archive</strong> button often. You can
also publish individual stories to files using the dropdown menu next to the
<b><i class="fa fa-play"></i>&nbsp;Play</b> button in the story editor. Both
archive and story files can always be re-imported into Twine.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, <b>anyone who can use this browser can see and make changes to your
work</b>. So if you've got a nosy kid brother, look into setting up a separate
profile for yourself.
