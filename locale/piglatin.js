The <a href=\"http://twinery.org/2guide\" target=\"_blank\">Twine 2 Guide</a>, and the official wiki in general, are a great place to learn. Keep in mind that some articles on the wiki at large were written for Twine 1, which is a little bit different than this version. But most of the concepts are the same.":["<strong>Ifway ou'veyay evernay usedway Inetway eforebay,</strong> enthay elcomeway!

Chief among them is a new default story format, Harlowe. But if you find you prefer the Twine 1 scripting syntax, try using SugarCube instead.":["<strong>Ifway ou'veyay evernay usedway Inetway eforebay,</strong> enthay elcomeway!

Since your work is saved only in your browser, if you clear its saved data, then you'll lose your work! Not good. Remember to use that <i class=\"fa fa-briefcase\"></i>&nbsp;<strong>Archive</strong> button often. You can also publish individual stories to files using the dropdown menu next to the <b><i class=\"fa fa-play\"></i>&nbsp;Play</b> button in the story editor. Both archive and story files can always be re-imported into Twine.":["Otway <b>eryvay importantway</b> ingsthay otay ememberray, oughthay.
