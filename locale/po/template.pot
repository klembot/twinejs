"the official wiki in general, are a great place to learn. Keep in mind that "
"some articles on the wiki at large were written for Twine 1, which is a "
"little bit different than this version. But most of the concepts are the "

"Two <b>very important</b> things to remember, though. Since your work is "

"also publish individual stories to files using the dropdown menu next to "
"the <b><i class=\"fa fa-play\"></i>&nbsp;Play</b> button in the story "
"editor. Both archive and story files can always be re-imported into Twine."
