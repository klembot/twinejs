The &lt;a href=\"http://twinery.org/2guide\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Twine 2 Guide&lt;/a&gt; and the official wiki in general, are a great place to learn. Keep in mind that some articles on the wiki at large were written for Twine 1, which is a little bit different than this version. But most of the concepts are the same." | say }}}
