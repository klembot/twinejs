Since your work is saved only in your browser, if you clear its saved data, then you'll lose your work! Not good. Remember to use that <strong>Archive</strong> button often. You can also publish individual stories to files using the menu on each story in the story list. Both archive and story files can always be re-imported into Twine.</p><p>Secondly, <strong>anyone who can use this browser can see and make changes to your work.</strong> So if you've got a nosy kid brother, look into setting up a separate profile for yourself.</p>",
